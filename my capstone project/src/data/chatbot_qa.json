    "question_text": "How much does a solar system cost in Africa?",
    "answer_text": "Solar system costs vary by country and system size. A basic home system (300W-1kW) typically ranges from $500-$2,000 USD, while larger systems (3-5kW) cost $3,000-$8,000. Prices include panels, inverter, batteries, and installation. Countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria have competitive markets with lower prices. Many providers offer pay-as-you-go (PAYG) plans starting from $0.50-$2 per day, making solar accessible without large upfront costs."

    "question_text": "How much money can I save with solar energy?",
    "answer_text": "Solar can reduce electricity costs by 50-100% depending on your current energy source. If using grid electricity, expect 50-80% savings (paying $50/month could drop to $10-25). If using kerosene, candles, or diesel generators, you could save 100% of those costs plus health benefits. A typical African household spending $30-60 monthly on kerosene and phone charging can recover solar investment within 1-3 years. Businesses using diesel generators save $0.30-$0.50 per kWh by switching to solar."

    "answer_text": "Solar systems in Africa typically offer 15-30% annual ROI with 3-7 year payback periods. Factors affecting ROI: current energy costs (higher costs = faster payback), system size, financing terms, and local electricity rates. Grid-connected areas see 5-7 year payback, while off-grid areas replacing generators/kerosene see 3-5 years. Over a 25-year lifespan, solar can save 5-10 times the initial investment. Businesses see even faster returns due to higher energy consumption and productivity gains."

Lithium batteries are 90% efficient vs 70-80% for lead-acid, require no maintenance, and last longer. For African conditions with temperature variations, lithium or quality tubular batteries perform best. Battery lifespan depends on proper charging, depth of discharge, and maintenance. Budget $150-$500 for replacement batteries depending on type and capacity."

    "question_text": "Does solar work during rainy season or cloudy days?",
    "answer_text": "Yes, solar panels work on cloudy days but at reduced efficiency (10-25% of sunny day output). During rainy seasons, panels produce 50-70% of dry season output. This is why proper system sizing includes battery storage for 1-3 days of backup power. Most African regions have excellent solar potential year-round (4-6 peak sun hours daily). Even during heavy rain, some power is generated. Well-designed systems account for seasonal variations. Countries near the equator have consistent sunlight year-round with minimal seasonal impact."

    "answer_text": "Solar systems need minimal maintenance: Panel cleaning every 2-4 weeks (or after dust storms) using water and soft cloth; check connections quarterly; monitor battery water levels monthly for lead-acid batteries (lithium needs no maintenance); inspect for shade from growing trees; professional check-up annually. In dusty areas, clean panels more frequently. Most systems include monitoring apps to track performance. Annual maintenance costs are typically $20-50. Proper maintenance ensures optimal performance and extends system life to 25+ years for panels and full battery lifespan."

However, professional installation is strongly recommended for: safety (electrical hazards), warranty validity (many warranties require certified installation), proper system sizing, optimal panel positioning, electrical code compliance, and connection to grid (where applicable). Professional installation costs $100-500 depending on system size. Many PAYG providers include free installation. Improper installation can damage equipment, void warranties, or create safety hazards. Use certified installers registered with your country's renewable energy association."

    "answer_text": "Off-grid: Complete independence from electricity grid, requires batteries, ideal for rural areas without grid access, higher initial cost but full energy autonomy. On-grid: Connected to utility grid, no batteries needed, sell excess power (net metering where available), lower cost, requires stable grid. Hybrid: Combines both, batteries for backup during outages, can use grid when needed, most flexible but highest cost. For most African contexts, off-grid or hybrid systems are preferred due to unreliable grid power. Urban areas with stable grid may prefer hybrid for backup during frequent outages."

    "answer_text": "Choose pure sine wave inverters for African applications - they protect sensitive electronics (laptops, TVs, fridges) and run appliances efficiently. Modified sine wave inverters are cheaper but damage electronics and reduce appliance lifespan. Inverter sizing: match or exceed your peak power demand plus 20-30% buffer. For example, if your maximum simultaneous appliance use is 1000W, get a 1200-1500W inverter. Hybrid inverters are ideal for African conditions - they manage solar, battery, and grid (where available) automatically. Recommended features: MPPT charge controllers (20-30% more efficient), overload protection, and low voltage disconnect for battery protection."

    "answer_text": "Charge controllers regulate power from panels to batteries, preventing overcharging and damage. Two types: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): 70-80% efficient, cheaper, suitable for small systems (under 500W), panels and battery voltages must match. MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking): 92-97% efficient, 20-30% more power harvest, works with voltage mismatches, better for larger systems, optimal for cloudy conditions. For African conditions, MPPT is recommended despite higher cost - the extra energy generation pays for itself within 1-2 years.

    "answer_text": "Solar panels actually lose efficiency in extreme heat (0.3-0.5% per degree above 25°C). However, African countries still have excellent solar potential due to intense sunlight and long sun hours (4-6.5 peak hours daily). Panel performance: at 45°C (common in African heat), panels operate at 90-92% of rated capacity. Solutions: proper ventilation beneath panels (10-15cm gap), choose panels with low temperature coefficients, tilt angles that allow air circulation. Despite heat losses, African solar systems outperform temperate climates due to superior irradiation. Countries like Namibia, Botswana, and Egypt have some of world's best solar resources."

Safety features: panels have no moving parts, low voltage DC systems (12V/24V) are safer than grid AC, modern inverters have multiple safety protections (short circuit, overload, surge protection), batteries are sealed to prevent leakage. Risks to avoid: improper wiring causing fires (use certified installers), electrical shock from faulty connections, battery acid exposure from damaged lead-acid batteries (lithium is safer). Safety certifications: look for IEC, TUV, or equivalent certifications. Lightning protection recommended in storm-prone areas.
